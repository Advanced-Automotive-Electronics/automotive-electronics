# TurtleBot 4 Robot

Source code is available [here](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4_robot).

```note
The `turtlebot4_robot` metapackage can be installed on a Raspberry Pi 4B running Ubuntu Server 20.04 with ROS2 Galactic.
```

## Installation

The `turtlebot4_robot` metapackage is pre-installed on the TurtleBot 4 Raspberry Pi image.

### Source installation

To manually install this metapackage from source, clone the git repository:

```bash
cd ~/turtlebot4_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4_robot.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
cd ~/turtlebot4_ws
vcs import src < src/turtlebot4_robot/dependencies.repos
rosdep install --from-path src -yi
```

Build the packages:

```bash
source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash
colcon build --symlink-install
```

## Base

The `turtlebot4_base` package contains the source code for the [rclcpp](https://github.com/ros2/rclcpp) node `turtlebot4_base_node` which runs on the physical robot. This node interfaces with the GPIO lines of the Raspberry Pi which allows it to read the state of the buttons, as well as write to the LEDs and display.

Publishers:
- **/hmi/buttons**: *turtlebot4_msgs/msg/UserButton*
    - description: Button states of the TurtleBot 4 HMI (TurtleBot 4 model only).

Subscribers:
- **/hmi/display**: *turtlebot4_msgs/msg/UserDisplay*
    - description: The current information that is to be displayed (TurtleBot 4 model only).
- **/hmi/led/\_\<led\>**: *std_msgs/msg/Int32*
    - description: Hidden topics indicating the state of each LED.

### GPIO Interface

The TurtleBot 4 uses *libgpiod* to interface with the GPIO lines of the Raspberry Pi. The `gpiochip0` device represents the 40-pin header of the Raspberry Pi and is used for reading and writing to these pins.

### I2C Interface

The linux I2C drivers are used to read and write data on the I2C buses of the Raspberry Pi. The display's SSD1306 driver is connected to the `i2c-3` device by default, but other buses are available too.

### SSD1306

The SSD1306 is a driver for OLED displays. It receives commands over a communication bus (I2C for the TurtleBot 4) and controls how the physical display behaves. The TurtleBot 4 uses a modified version of this [STM32 SSD1306 driver](https://github.com/afiskon/stm32-ssd1306) to write pixels, shapes and characters to the display.

### Configuration

```warning
Do NOT change pin definitions if you are using the standard PCBA or do not know what you are doing.
```

The `turtlebot4_base_node` pin definitions can be set with ROS parameters. The default configuration is:

```yaml
turtlebot4_base_node:
  ros__parameters:
    # GPIO definition for HMI. Do NOT change if you are using the standard PCBA.
    gpio:
      user_button_1: 13
      user_button_2: 19
      user_button_3: 16
      user_button_4: 26

      led_green_power: 17
      led_green_motors: 18
      led_green_comms: 27
      led_green_wifi: 24
      led_green_battery: 22
      led_red_battery: 23
      led_green_user_1: 25
      led_green_user_2: 6
      led_red_user_2: 12

      display_reset: 2
```

```note
The value for each GPIO device is the GPIO number, NOT the pin number.
```

### Robot Upstart

The robot uses the [robot_upstart](https://github.com/clearpathrobotics/robot_upstart/tree/foxy-devel) package to install the bringup launch files as a background process that launches when the robot starts. The launch files are located under the `turtlebot4_bringup` package.

To check if the TurtleBot 4 service is running, use this command on the Raspberry Pi:

```bash
systemctl | grep turtlebot4
```

If the service is active, the CLI will echo `turtlebot4.service  loaded active running   "bringup turtlebot4"`.

To read the most recent logs from the service, call:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u turtlebot4 -r
```

To stop the service, call:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop turtlebot4.service
```

This will kill all of the nodes launched by the launch file. 

```note
The service will automatically start again on reboot. To fully disable the service, uninstall the job.
```

To start the service again, call:

```bash
sudo systemctl start turtlebot4.service
```

#### Installing

The [install.py](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4_setup/blob/galactic/scripts/install.py) script is available in */usr/local/bin* to make installing `robot_upstart` jobs easier.

To install a TurtleBot4 job, simply call:

```bash
install.py model <ROS_DOMAIN_ID>
```

where *model* is either *lite* or *standard*.

```note
The *ROS_DOMAIN_ID* is optional and defaults to 0. Remember to set the *ROS_DOMAIN_ID* of the Create速 3 and of your terminal to match.
```

To uninstall, call:

```bash
uninstall.py
```

Once uninstalled, the job no longer be launched on boot.


## Bringup

## Diagnostics

The `turtlebot4_diagnostics` packages contains the source code and launch files for the TurtleBot 4 diagnostics updater.

Launch files:

- **Diagnostics**: Launches the turtlebot4 diagnostics updater and the diagnostic aggregator node.

### Diagnostics Updater

The [diagnostics updater](https://github.com/turtlebot/turtlebot4_robot/blob/galactic/turtlebot4_diagnostics/turtlebot4_diagnostics/diagnostics_updater.py) is a Python3 node that runs on the robot. It subscribes to diagnostic topics records statistics specific to each topic. The diagnostic data is viewable with `rqt_robot_monitor`.

Diagnostic topics:

- **/battery_state**: Check battery voltage and percentage.
- **/wheel_status**: Check if wheels are enabled.
- **/dock**: Check if the robot is docked.
- **/scan**: Check the frequency of laser scans from the RPLIDAR.
- **/left/image**: Check the frequency of images from the left OAK-D camera.
- **/right/image**: Check the frequency of images from the right OAK-D camera.
- **/color/image**: Check the frequency of images from the OAK-D colour sensor.
- **/stereo/image**: Check the frequency of depth images from the OAK-D.
- **/hazard_detection**: Check for detected hazards.
- **/imu**: Check the frequency of IMU messages.
- **/mouse**: Check the frequency of Mouse messages.

Viewing diagnostics:

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot4_viz view_diagnostics.launch.py
```

### Tests

The `turtlebot4_tests` packages contains the source code for the TurtleBot 4 system test scripts. These scripts test basic functionality of the robot and are useful for troubleshooting issues.

### ROS Tests

The ROS tests use ROS topics and actions to test various system functionality. Test results are saved to `~/turtlebot4_test_results/Y_m_d-H_M_S` where `Y_m_d-H_M_S` is the date and time of the test. A rosbag is also recorded for the duration of the test and saved to the same location.

Currently supported tests:

- **Light Ring**: Test the Create速 3 light ring
- **Create速 3 Button**: Test the Create速 3 buttons
- **User LED**: Test the HMI LEDs (TurtleBot 4 model only)
- **User Button**: Test the HMI buttons (TurtleBot 4 model only)
- **Display**: Test the HMI display (TurtleBot 4 model only)
- **Dock**: Test the robots ability to undock and dock.

Running the tests:

```bash
ros2 run turtlebot4_tests ros_tests
```

This will launch a CLI menu where the different tests can be run.

Enter the index of the test and hit enter to start the test. Some tests will run automatically while others require user input.
